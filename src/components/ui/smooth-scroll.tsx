/**
 * SmoothScroll
 *
 * Initialises Lenis — the smooth-scroll library that was already installed
 * but never wired up. Lenis intercepts native scroll events and replaces
 * them with momentum-based easing, giving the site a premium inertial feel.
 *
 * Must be rendered inside a Client Component tree. Mount it once at the
 * root (layout.tsx or page.tsx) so it covers the entire page.
 *
 * Integration with Framer Motion:
 * Lenis exposes an onScroll callback that we use to sync Framer Motion's
 * scroll tracker, so whileInView and useScroll hooks still work correctly.
